# "MARY sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
# Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,
# She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
# To meet him in the doorway with the news
# And put him on his guard. “Silas is back.”
# She pushed him outward with her through the door
# And shut it after her. “Be kind,” she said.
# She took the market things from Warren’s arms
# And set them on the porch, then drew him down
# To sit beside her on the wooden steps.
#
# “When was I ever anything but kind to him?
# But I’ll not have the fellow back,” he said.
# “I told him so last haying, didn’t I?
# ‘If he left then,’ I said, ‘that ended it.’
# What good is he? Who else will harbour him
# At his age for the little he can do?
# What help he is there’s no depending on.
# Off he goes always when I need him most.
# ‘He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,
# Enough at least to buy tobacco with,
# So he won’t have to beg and be beholden.’
# ‘All right,’ I say, ‘I can’t afford to pay
# Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.’
# ‘Someone else can.’ ‘Then someone else will have to.’
# I shouldn’t mind his bettering himself
# If that was what it was. You can be certain,
# When he begins like that, there’s someone at him
# Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,—
# In haying time, when any help is scarce.
# In winter he comes back to us. I’m done.”
#
# “Sh! not so loud: he’ll hear you,” Mary said.
#
# “I want him to: he’ll have to soon or late.”
#
# “He’s worn out. He’s asleep beside the stove.
# When I came up from Rowe’s I found him here,
# Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,
# A miserable sight, and frightening, too—
# You needn’t smile—I didn’t recognise him—
# I wasn’t looking for him—and he’s changed.
# Wait till you see.”
#
# “Where did you say he’d been?”
#
# “He didn’t say. I dragged him to the house,
# And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.
# I tried to make him talk about his travels.
# Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.”
#
# “What did he say? Did he say anything?”
#
# “But little.”
#
# “Anything? Mary, confess
# He said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.”
#
# “Warren!”
#
# “But did he? I just want to know.”
#
# “Of course he did. What would you have him say?
# Surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man
# Some humble way to save his self-respect.
# He added, if you really care to know,
# He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.
# That sounds like something you have heard before?
# Warren, I wish you could have heard the way
# He jumbled everything. I stopped to look
# Two or three times—he made me feel so queer—
# To see if he was talking in his sleep.
# He ran on Harold Wilson—you remember—
# The boy you had in haying four years since.
# He’s finished school, and teaching in his college.
# Silas declares you’ll have to get him back.
# He says they two will make a team for work:
# Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
# The way he mixed that in with other things.
# He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft
# On education—you know how they fought
# All through July under the blazing sun,
# Silas up on the cart to build the load,
# Harold along beside to pitch it on.”
#
# “Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.”
#
# “Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.
# You wouldn’t think they would. How some things linger!
# Harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him.
# After so many years he still keeps finding
# Good arguments he sees he might have used.
# I sympathise. I know just how it feels
# To think of the right thing to say too late.
# Harold’s associated in his mind with Latin.
# He asked me what I thought of Harold’s saying
# He studied Latin like the violin
# Because he liked it—that an argument!
# He said he couldn’t make the boy believe
# He could find water with a hazel prong—
# Which showed how much good school had ever done him.
# He wanted to go over that. But most of all
# He thinks if he could have another chance
# To teach him how to build a load of hay——”
#
# “I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment.
# He bundles every forkful in its place,
# And tags and numbers it for future reference,
# So he can find and easily dislodge it
# In the unloading. Silas does that well.
# He takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests.
# You never see him standing on the hay
# He’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.”
#
# “He thinks if he could teach him that, he’d be
# Some good perhaps to someone in the world.
# He hates to see a boy the fool of books.
# Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,
# And nothing to look backward to with pride,
# And nothing to look forward to with hope,
# So now and never any different.”
#
# Part of a moon was falling down the west,
# Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.
# Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw
# And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand
# Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,
# Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,
# As if she played unheard some tenderness
# That wrought on him beside her in the night.
# “Warren,” she said, “he has come home to die:
# You needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.”
#
# “Home,” he mocked gently.
#
# “Yes, what else but home?
# It all depends on what you mean by home.
# Of course he’s nothing to us, any more
# Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
# Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.”
#
# “Home is the place where, when you have to go there,
# They have to take you in.”
#
# “I should have called it
# Something you somehow haven’t to deserve.”
#
# Warren leaned out and took a step or two,
# Picked up a little stick, and brought it back
# And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.
# “Silas has better claim on us you think
# Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles
# As the road winds would bring him to his door.
# Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.
# Why didn’t he go there? His brother’s rich,
# A somebody—director in the bank.”
#
# “He never told us that.”
#
# “We know it though.”
#
# “I think his brother ought to help, of course.
# I’ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right
# To take him in, and might be willing to—
# He may be better than appearances.
# But have some pity on Silas. Do you think
# If he’d had any pride in claiming kin
# Or anything he looked for from his brother,
# He’d keep so still about him all this time?”
#
# “I wonder what’s between them.”
#
# “I can tell you.
# Silas is what he is—we wouldn’t mind him—
# But just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide.
# He never did a thing so very bad.
# He don’t know why he isn’t quite as good
# As anybody. Worthless though he is,
# He won't be made ashamed to please his brother.”
#
# “I can’t think Si ever hurt anyone.”
#
# “No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay
# And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.
# He wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge.
# You must go in and see what you can do.
# I made the bed up for him there to-night.
# You’ll be surprised at him—how much he’s broken.
# His working days are done; I’m sure of it.”
#
# “I’d not be in a hurry to say that.”
#
# “I haven’t been. Go, look, see for yourself.
# But, Warren, please remember how it is:
# He’s come to help you ditch the meadow.
# He has a plan. You mustn’t laugh at him.
# He may not speak of it, and then he may.
# I’ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud
# Will hit or miss the moon.”
#
# It hit the moon.
# Then there were three there, making a dim row,
# The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.
#
# Warren returned—too soon, it seemed to her,
# Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.
#
# “Warren,” she questioned.
#
# “Dead,” was all he answered.", author:"Robert Frost")

# That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
# And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
# And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
# The work of hunters is another thing:
# I have come after them and made repair
# Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
# But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
# To please the yelping dogs.  The gaps I mean,
# No one has seen them made or heard them made,
# But at spring mending-time we find them there.
# I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
# And on a day we meet to walk the line
# And set the wall between us once again.
# We keep the wall between us as we go.
# To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
# And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
# We have to use a spell to make them balance:
# ‘Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'
# We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
# Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
# One on a side.  It comes to little more:
# There where it is we do not need the wall:
# He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
# My apple trees will never get across

# Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
# If I could put a notion in his head:
# 'Why do they make good neighbors?  Isn’t it
# Where there are cows?  But here there are no cows.
# Before I built a wall I’d ask to know

# He said it for himself.  I see him there
# Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
# In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
# He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
# Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
# He will not go behind his father’s saying,
# And he likes having thought of it so well
# He says again, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.", author:"Robert Frost")
